HOW TO USE: <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Chose a target on BSC (go on Poocoin search for a high cap or trending token and look for a big transaction, then check the it's wallet if is big take the address) and fill the box.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Set the balance of BNB to use from 0.05(5%) to 1(100%).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;<b>---!!! for the bot to work properly it need at leas 0.5 BNB  !!!---</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Set the minimum ammount of BNB to follow (Bigger=better).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;We use our node (To have more efficient transaction combined with auto slippage-gas).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The gas multiplier nad the slippage will be set automatically (To maximize the revenue).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Set the minimum amount to follow like 15 BNB (The value are in BNB).<br>

INFO:<br>
I created this bot with some friends a few months ago from now, this bot uses an old method now but is still does his job. We decided to sell it because we have a new bot with new method right now so we don't use that anymore.<br>

FLEX<br> Our new bot as you can see from bsc transaction it's fully automated and it goes on 24/24 on a vps. It uses random balance, multiple targets, private node, and buys and sells in same block as the target.
